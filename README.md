# **GARUDA - Geospatial Analysis for Rural and Urban Development using AI**

**GARUDA** is an AI-driven solution built to transform satellite and aerial imagery into actionable geospatial insights for rural and urban development. This project is part of **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**, where the goal is to develop the solution entirely from scratch, without relying on pre-trained models, to showcase a fully custom-built system tailored to the given problem statement.

With this solution, we aim to assist government officials, urban planners, and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions using advanced machine learning and geospatial analysis techniques.

## **Project Highlights**
- **Custom-built Machine Learning Models**: No use of pre-trained models like YOLO or others; every component of this project is developed from scratch to demonstrate technical proficiency.
- **Advanced Geospatial Analysis**: The solution handles complex geospatial datasets such as drone imagery and GIS files, enabling high-precision feature extraction and classification.
- **Simulation Module**: Includes a simulation feature that allows government officials to virtually modify the environment of a village or area and observe the projected impacts on the community and resources before implementing changes in the real world.
- **Supports the SVAMITVA Scheme**: Aligns with the government’s initiative for accurate land record management and rural development.

## **What Can This Program Do?**

1. **Land Use and Building Classification**:
   - Identifies and classifies building footprints, roof types (RCC, Tiled, Tin, Others), and other structures from high-resolution drone imagery.
   
2. **Crop Analysis and Vegetation Health Monitoring**:
   - Classifies various crop types, assesses vegetation health, and provides yield forecasts using AI-based classification and regression models.

3. **Road and Waterbody Segmentation**:
   - Segments and identifies roads, sidewalks, rivers, lakes, and other water bodies to support infrastructure planning and environmental management.

4. **Cloud Detection and Removal**:
   - Detects and removes cloud cover from satellite images to ensure a clearer view of the ground.

5. **Disaster Response and Environmental Impact Analysis**:
   - Supports real-time monitoring for disaster-prone areas, helping authorities in preemptive planning and response strategies.

6. **Simulation Feature**:
   - Simulates development plans or environmental changes for a given area, allowing officials to see potential impacts on the environment and community before real-world implementation.

## **How We’re Building It from Scratch**
- The project uses custom deep learning models such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **U-Net**, and **Region-based CNN (RCNN)** for classification, segmentation, and object detection.
- Instead of pre-trained models, all models are developed, trained, and optimized from scratch, using unique datasets specifically tailored to the requirements of geospatial analysis.
- **Geospatial Libraries**: Implements `Geopandas`, `Shapely`, and `GDAL` for handling complex GIS datasets and integrating them into AI workflows.
- **Real-time Drone Integration**: Designed to work with real-time data collected from drones, providing on-the-fly analysis during aerial surveys.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Geospatial Libraries**: Geopandas, Rasterio, GDAL, Fiona
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV
- **Simulation Tools**: Unity or Unreal Engine for the simulation module
- **Cloud Computing**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or AWS for cloud-based analysis and deployment

## **Use Case Scenarios**
1. **Government Agencies**: Accurate land record management, rural planning, and impact analysis.
2. **Urban Planners**: Better decision-making for urban infrastructure development and resource allocation.
3. **Agricultural Stakeholders**: Crop yield forecasting, land use optimization, and risk management.
4. **Disaster Management Teams**: Real-time environmental monitoring for preemptive planning and response.

## **Building It for Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**
The project is part of **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**, focusing on real-world problem statements provided by the Indian government. The goal is to develop a comprehensive solution from the ground up, covering all aspects of data preparation, model development, testing, and deployment. GARUDA is designed to align with government initiatives such as the **SVAMITVA Scheme**, supporting accurate land records and sustainable development planning.
